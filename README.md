## Hi there üëã, I'm Camila
A **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **UC Davis** with a minor in **Tech Management**, passionate about **Software Development**, **AI/ML**, **Backend**, and **Full Stack**. I am actively working on building my skills to become a well-rounded software engineer.

Through both academic coursework and hands-on projects, I've developed a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and collaboration. I am particularly excited about working in **Software** and **AI/ML**, with past experiences in projects such as **CowCulator** and **Vaccuum Diagnostics**. I have experience using **Python**, **C++**, **JavaScript**, and tools like **Git** for version control.

In addition to technical projects, I‚Äôm an active member of student organizations like the **CS Tutoring Club**, where I serve as the **VP of Logistics** and contribute to initiatives that bring together students, professors, and industry leaders. I also enjoy helping **research** in the UCD Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) lab for the **Vacuum Microelectronics Research Group**.

My goal is to continue developing my technical and leadership skills, contribute to innovative projects, and grow within the tech industry. I'm excited about pursuing a career in software engineering, where I can apply my knowledge to solve complex problems and work in a collaborative, fast-paced environment.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and check out some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on. I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and discussing new opportunities to grow and learn!

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects
- [**Vaccuum Diagnostics**](https://github.com/CCEW/vacuum_diagnostics) A machine learning project in Python that detects anomalies/system disturbances (sudden manipulations, pump instabilities, potential leaks) with the Isolation Forest model.
- [**CowCulator**](https://github.com/GDSC-UCD-Cohort-24-25/Chroma) A full-stack budget tracking website built in React(Typescript) and Node.js, featuring user authentication with JWT, data storage and manipulation via RESTful APIs and MongoDB (Mongoose), and deployed using Vite.
- [**Song Genre Classification**](https://github.com/ReehalS/TeamTBD_SongClassifier): A machine learning project for classifying song into genres using the XGB model that achieved 78% accuracy.
- [**Minecraft 2D XYZ**](https://github.com/CCEW/Project-CS1111): An object-oriented, 2D world-building game in Python, where players can explore a procedurally generated 30x20 grid world, interact with various objects (trees, rocks, etc.), collect resources (wood and stone), and build or destroy blocks within the environment.
