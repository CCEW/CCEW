## Hi there üëã, I'm Camila
A **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **UC Davis**, passionate about **Software Development**, **AI/ML**, and **Web Development**. I am actively working on building my skills to become a well-rounded software engineer.

Through both academic coursework and hands-on projects, I've developed a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and collaboration. I am particularly excited about working with **Object-Oriented programming** and **AI/ML**, with past experiences in projects such as **Minecraft XYZ** and **Song Genre Classification**. I have experience using **Python**, **C++**, and tools like **Git** for version control.

In addition to technical projects, I‚Äôm an active member of student organizations like the **CS Tutoring Club**, where I serve as the **Logistics Officer** and contribute to initiatives that bring together students, professors, and industry leaders. I also enjoy working on group projects in club organizations like Google Developer Student Club.

My goal is to continue developing my technical and leadership skills, contribute to innovative projects, and grow within the tech industry. I'm excited about pursuing a career in software engineering, where I can apply my knowledge to solve complex problems and work in a collaborative, fast-paced environment.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and check out some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on. I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and discussing new opportunities to grow and learn!
